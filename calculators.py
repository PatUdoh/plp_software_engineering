# Welcome to the Fun Calculator
# We're going yo add, subtract, multipy, and divide two numbers like a boss

# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
# We're using 'float()' to make sure our numbers can have decimal
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input second number
# Same trick here-using 'float()' for decimal magic!
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))


#Step 3: Time to do some math! Let's compute the sum, difference, product and quot

# Add the two numbers (Yay! Addition is the first step to fun)
sum_result = num1 + num2

#Subtract the second number from the first (Negative vibes, but necessary)
difference_result = num1 - num2

# Multiply the two numbers (More bang for your buck!)
product_result = num1 * num2

# Divide the first number by the second (Be careful with zero here, no math disaster)
# We'll assume the user is being responsible and not dividing by zero for now
quotient_result = num1 / num2

#Step 4: Show the user what we got! Timw for the big reveal!
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}") # +
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}") # -
print(f"Product: {product_result}") # x
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}") 

# And that's it! I've just made a mini-calculator!
